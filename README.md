ABOUT  US
Paradox is an offshore software development company with a focus on state-of-the-art technologies. We have our niche in Blockchain, Networking, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. We monitor closely the latest trends and technologies and with our highly skilled team of developers, we deliver end-to-end development solutions. 


The Paradox Network is Ethereum's version of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, enabling fast, cheap, scalable payments.
 

1.	SCALABILITY - Off-chain payment channels capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.
2. TRANSACTIONS - Lightning-fast payments without worrying about block confirmation times.
3.	COMISSION FEES - By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Paradox Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.
4.	TRUST - The Paradox Network is a technology invented to extend the capabilities of Ethereum's blockchain. Payment channels create the new model of trust, extending and improving upon the properties of Ethereum.

Together with other companies, we are developing solutions to existing blockchains. Our contributions are:
 

•	PRX Bidirectional Payment Channel Protocol
•	PRX MERCHANT Compact Payment Channel Protocol
•	PARADOX Zero Fee (100% Merchant sposored) Payment Model
• Trusted Partners Scoring System (work in progress)
• Multidirectional Payment Channel protocol (work in progress)

PRX Tokens are ERC20-compliant tokens.
 

•	ERC20 tokens are smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain.
•	They are digitized currencies, encrypted through cryptography.
•	Paradox(PRX) Tokens are used to create micropayment channels and perform payments over the Paradox Network.
•	They power the system, which enables scalable, low latency, low cost transfers.
•	All services, fees and costs on the Paradox Network are paid with PRX.

FAQ (Frequently asked questions)
 

What is an off-chain scaling solution?
An off-chain scaling solution is an overlay network built on top of an existing blockchain protocol. Similar to how the Internet is built in layers, The Paradox Network creates an entirely new layer, offering lightning-fast payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Our implementation is Ethereum's version of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, enabling fast, cheap, scalable payments.
What are PRX tokens and what can I do with them?
Paradox(PRX) Tokens are used to create micropayment channels and perform payments over the Paradox Network. They power the system, which enables scalable, low latency, low cost transfers.
What Problems does The Paradox Network solve?
User growth and application innovation in the blockchain ecosystem are driving the need for new protocol layers that build on the security and ubiquity of blockchains. PRX is one of these protocols, providing blockchains with the scalability to support magnitudes more users as well as the flexibility to support a new wave of financial applications.
Do I have to do registration and KYC?
Yes. Registration and KYC is mandatory.
What do I need to provide for KYC?
Determine if you intend to bid MORE than 0.2 ETH, and only if so, you are required to go through this KYC process in order to participate in the auction. There is NO need to do KYC for individuals or institutions sending amounts smaller than 0.2 ETH. • Please provide the following information: Nationality, Name, Email, Address. We may ask for additional information in certain cases.

What’s the meaning behind the ‘Paradox’ name?
Paradox is latin and means a seemingly absurd statement. We believe that "Sometimes Off-chain can improve Blockchain", which is clearly a self-contradictory proposition.
Where is Paradox based?
Paradox’ administration is based in St Julian's, Malta. The development team and part of the management is based in Mellieha, Malta, where Paradox was founded.
