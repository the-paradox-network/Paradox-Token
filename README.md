ABOUT  US
Paradox is an offshore software development company with a focus on state-of-the-art technologies. We have our niche in Blockchain, Networking, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. We monitor closely the latest trends and technologies and with our highly skilled team of developers, we deliver end-to-end development solutions. 


The Paradox Network is Ethereum's version of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, enabling fast, cheap, scalable payments.
 

1.	SCALABILITY - Off-chain payment channels capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.
2. TRANSACTIONS - Lightning-fast payments without worrying about block confirmation times.
3.	COMISSION FEES - By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Paradox Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.
4.	TRUST - The Paradox Network is a technology invented to extend the capabilities of Ethereum's blockchain. Payment channels create the new model of trust, extending and improving upon the properties of Ethereum.

Together with other companies, we are developing solutions to existing blockchains. Our contributions are:
 

•	PRX Bidirectional Payment Channel Protocol
•	PRX MERCHANT Compact Payment Channel Protocol
•	PARADOX Zero Fee (100% Merchant sposored) Payment Model
• Trusted Partners Scoring System (work in progress)
• Multidirectional Payment Channel protocol (work in progress)

PRX Tokens are ERC20-compliant tokens.
 

•	ERC20 tokens are smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain.
•	They are digitized currencies, encrypted through cryptography.
•	Paradox(PRX) Tokens are used to create micropayment channels and perform payments over the Paradox Network.
•	They power the system, which enables scalable, low latency, low cost transfers.
•	All services, fees and costs on the Paradox Network are paid with PRX.
